**Project:** RecruitX

**Goal:** Develop a multi-agent web application that analyzes Job Descriptions (JDs) and Candidate CVs using Gemini AI to generate a sophisticated scoring system, identifying the best-fit candidates. Focus on creating a powerful AI assistant for recruiters.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **SOTA Driven:** Continuously research and integrate the best available techniques for each component (parsing, analysis, scoring, RAG).
2.  **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Design distinct AI agents with specific roles, leveraging Gemini's capabilities.
3.  **Scalability & Maintainability:** Build clean, well-structured code suitable for different environments (dev, test, prod).
4.  **User-Centric:** Focus on providing clear, actionable insights and explainability to recruiters.

**Current AI Agents (Implemented & Tested):**

1.  **JD Analysis Agent:**
    *   Parses uploaded JDs (text extraction working).
    *   Uses Gemini to extract key requirements, skills, experience, etc., via function calling.
    *   Structures this information for comparison.
2.  **CV Analysis Agent:**
    *   Parses uploaded CVs (text extraction needed in API).
    *   Uses Gemini to extract contact info, work history, education, skills, projects, etc.
    *   Standardizes and structures the extracted CV data.
3.  **Orchestration Agent (for Scoring):**
    *   Receives JD and CV text.
    *   Orchestrates a two-step process:
        *   Step 1: Uses Gemini to extract skills from both JD and CV.
        *   Step 2: Uses Gemini to synthesize a score (0-100) and explanation based on full texts and extracted skills.
    *   Provides explainability for the score.

**(Potential Later) RAG Agent:** A specialized agent or integrated component focused on retrieving relevant information from documents or external sources to ground analysis and scoring.

**High-Level Technology Stack:**

*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) - Modern, high-performance framework suitable for AI/ML integration. **[Selected & Setup]**
*   **Frontend:** React, Vue, or Angular (To be decided later) - Modern JavaScript frameworks for building interactive UIs.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Implicitly chosen via SQLAlchemy setup) - Based on data structure needs. **[Setup with SQLAlchemy & Alembic]**
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (via Python client library using `google-generativeai`). **[Integrated & Tested]**
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Cloud Platform (GCP, AWS, Azure).

    *   âœ… Integrated Gemini API calls.
    *   âœ… Developed prompts for extracting structured info.
    *   âœ… Stores structured CV analysis results (`Candidate.analysis` field).
    *   âœ… Tested successfully.
4.  âœ… **Scoring & Matching Agent (OrchestrationAgent v1):**
    *   âœ… Develops two-step logic (skill extraction, score synthesis).
    *   âœ… Implements scoring mechanism using Gemini.
    *   âœ… Defines `Score` schema/model.
    *   âœ… Tested successfully.
5.  âœ… **API Expansion:** Endpoints to trigger scoring (`/api/v1/scores/`) and retrieve scores.

**Phase 4: Frontend Development & Integration (Est. 4-6 Weeks) - [Not Started]**

1.    âšª **Frontend Setup:** Choose and set up the frontend framework.
2.    âšª **UI Components:** Build UI for:
    *   Uploading JDs and CVs.
    *   Viewing lists of Jobs and Candidates.
    *   Displaying analysis results and scores for a specific match (including professional report styling).
3.  âšª **API Integration:** Connect frontend components to the backend APIs.

**Phase 5: SOTA Refinement & Advanced Features (Ongoing)**
