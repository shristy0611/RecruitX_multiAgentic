# RecruitX Testing - Next Steps

## Current Status: 67% Test Coverage

We have made significant progress in improving the test coverage for the RecruitX project. The following components now have good test coverage:

- `simple_scoring_agent.py` (77% coverage)
- `candidate_service.py` (97% coverage)
- `job_service.py` (89% coverage)
- `cv_analysis_agent.py` (84% coverage, improved from 49%)
- `jd_analysis_agent.py` (55% coverage, improved from 29%)
- `agentic_rag_service.py` (91% coverage, improved from 50%)

## Testing Priorities

To further improve the test coverage, we should focus on the following components in order of priority:

### 1. `vector_db_service.py` (68% coverage)

The vector database service integrates with ChromaDB and handles embeddings and similarity searches. While it has reasonable coverage, enhancing tests for edge cases and error handling would strengthen our confidence in the system's reliability.

### 2. API Endpoints (40-50% coverage)

The API endpoints in `recruitx_app/api/v1/endpoints/` have relatively low coverage. Improving tests for these endpoints would ensure the application's interface is reliable and properly validated.

### 3. Agents with 0% Coverage

The following agents currently have no test coverage and should be addressed after the higher priority components:

- `code_execution_agent.py`: Used for executing code snippets in a sandbox environment.
- `integrated_agent.py`: Combines multiple agent functionalities for complex tasks.
- `multimodal_agent.py`: Handles both text and image inputs.
- `tool_use_agent.py`: Manages tool selection and application.

## Testing Strategy

For each component, we should focus on:

1. **Core functionality tests**: Ensure the primary methods are tested for successful execution paths
2. **Error handling tests**: Verify that the component gracefully handles failures and exceptions
3. **Integration tests**: Ensure the component works correctly with other parts of the system
4. **Edge case tests**: Test boundary conditions and unusual inputs

## Target Coverage Goal

We have updated our target to achieve at least 75% overall test coverage by the next milestone, with no individual component below 60% coverage. With our recent progress, we are well on track to meet or exceed this goal.

## Recent Achievements

- **cv_analysis_agent.py**: Increased coverage from 49% to 84% by adding comprehensive tests for all major methods
- **agentic_rag_service.py**: Dramatically increased coverage from 50% to 91% by adding tests for error handling scenarios
- **Overall coverage**: Increased from 61% to 67%
- **All tests**: 140 tests now passing successfully
