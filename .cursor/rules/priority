**Analysis:**

*   We have a working backend core with JD analysis and scoring functional *if* the data exists.
*   The critical missing piece for a user workflow is **getting CV data into the system** and managing candidates.
*   Improving the *quality* of analysis/scoring (prompts, RAG) is valuable but depends on having the core workflow operational.
*   Recruiter UX features (batching, filtering, UI) depend on the core backend APIs being complete and robust.
*   Frontend depends entirely on having the necessary backend APIs.

**Prioritized Plan:**

Hereâ€™s a suggested priority order that focuses on enabling the core workflow first, then enhancing quality and adding recruiter-specific features:

**Priority 1: Enable Core Candidate Workflow (Complete Phase 3)**

1.  **Implement CV Upload API (`POST /api/v1/candidates/upload`)**:
    *   *Goal:* Allow users to upload CV files (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
    *   *Steps:* Create the FastAPI endpoint, reuse the `extract_text_from_file` utility, create a `Candidate` record using `CandidateService.create_candidate`. Decide if analysis should be triggered immediately upon upload or separately.
    *   *Depends on:* Existing `CandidateService`, `extract_text_from_file`.
    *   *Enables:* Storing candidate data, prerequisite for CV analysis and scoring on user data.
    *   *Roadmap:* Phase 3, Item 1 & 2.
2.  **Implement Basic Candidate API Endpoints:**
    *   *Goal:* Allow basic management and viewing of candidates.
    *   *Steps:*
        *   `GET /api/v1/candidates/`: List candidates (with pagination).
        *   `GET /api/v1/candidates/{candidate_id}`: Get details of a specific candidate (including their `analysis` if available).
        *   `POST /api/v1/candidates/{candidate_id}/analyze`: Endpoint to explicitly trigger `CandidateService.analyze_cv` if not done automatically on upload.
        *   (Optional) `DELETE /api/v1/candidates/{candidate_id}`: Delete a candidate.
    *   *Depends on:* `CandidateService`, `Candidate` model/schema.
    *   *Enables:* Viewing candidate data, managing candidates, triggering analysis, feeding data to scoring and future frontend.
    *   *Roadmap:* Related to Phase 3 completion / Phase 5 groundwork.

**Priority 2: Refine Core AI Quality (Address Phase 5, Item 1)**

3.  **Refine Scoring Agent Prompts (`simple_scoring_agent.py`)**:
    *   *Goal:* Improve the accuracy, detail, and reliability of the skill extraction and score synthesis steps.
    *   *Steps:* Review `SKILL_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` and `SCORE_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT`. Experiment with different phrasing, requesting specific formats, or adding few-shot examples if needed. Test changes with `test_scoring.py`.
    *   *Depends on:* Completed Priority 1 (to have easy testing).
    *   *Enables:* Higher quality scoring results.
4.  **Refine JD & CV Analysis Agent Prompts (`jd_analysis_agent.py`, `cv_analysis_agent.py`)**:
    *   *Goal:* Improve the structured data extraction from JDs and CVs.
    *   *Steps:* Review `JD_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` and the CV analysis prompt. Ensure all desired fields are being extracted reliably. Test with respective test scripts.
    *   *Depends on:* Completed Priority 1.
    *   *Enables:* More accurate inputs for the scoring process and richer data for the frontend.

**Priority 3: Enhance Recruiter Backend Features (Address Phase 5, Item 6)**

5.  **Improve Batch Scoring (`/api/v1/scores/batch`)**:
    *   *Goal:* Make batch scoring more robust and potentially faster (if API limits allow agent-level batching).
    *   *Steps:* Analyze current endpoint limitations. Explore if the `OrchestrationAgent` can process multiple candidates per API call (might require prompt changes) or improve error handling/status reporting in the API loop.
    *   *Depends on:* Completed Priority 1 & 2.
    *   *Enables:* More efficient processing for recruiters with many candidates.
6.  **Add API Support for Ranking/Filtering Scores:**
    *   *Goal:* Allow retrieving scores for a job, sorted or filtered by specific criteria.
    *   *Steps:* Modify `GET /api/v1/scores/job/{job_id}` endpoint (or create a new one) to accept query parameters (e.g., `min_score`, `sort_by`, `required_skill`). Implement the filtering/sorting logic in the `ScoringService`.
    *   *Depends on:* Completed Priority 1 & 2.
    *   *Enables:* Backend support for advanced frontend ranking features.

**Priority 4: Begin Frontend & Advanced Backend R&D (Address Phase 4 & Phase 5)**

7.  **Frontend Setup & Basic UI:**
    *   *Goal:* Get the frontend project started and build initial interfaces.
    *   *Steps:* Choose framework (React?), set up project, build basic components for upload, lists, and displaying analysis/scores. Integrate with the completed backend APIs.
    *   *Depends on:* Completed Priority 1 APIs.
    *   *Enables:* User interaction with the application.
8.  **Research/Plan RAG & Advanced Scoring:**
    *   *Goal:* Investigate and plan the implementation of more advanced techniques.
    *   *Steps:* Research RAG libraries/approaches suitable for Gemini. Explore vector databases, semantic search integration. Define how these would fit into the existing agent architecture.
    *   *Depends on:* Core system being stable.
    *   *Enables:* Next-generation features for grounding and scoring accuracy.

This plan focuses on building the essential blocks first (getting data in and managing it) before refining the AI quality and adding the more sophisticated recruiter-focused features and UI.
