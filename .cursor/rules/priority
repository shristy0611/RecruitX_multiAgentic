Okay, let's review the project status based on the provided documents and chart the course forward, incorporating SOTA techniques where appropriate.

**Current Status Summary:**

Based on our `ROADMAP.md` and `.cursor/rules/priority`:

*   **Foundation & JD Handling (Phases 1 & 2):** ‚úÖ 100% Complete. Project setup, backend framework, database, basic APIs, Gemini connection, JD upload, parsing, analysis, and storage are all functional.
*   **CV Agent & Basic Matching (Phase 3):** ‚úÖ ~90% Complete. CV upload, parsing, analysis (using JSON output), basic scoring orchestration, candidate CRUD APIs, and score retrieval APIs are implemented on the backend.
*   **Frontend (Phase 4):** üöß ~10% Complete. Basic setup with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS is done. Core UI components and API integration are pending.
*   **SOTA Refinements & Advanced Features (Phase 5):** üöß ~15% Complete. Some groundwork is laid:
    *   Vector store (ChromaDB) setup initiated.
    *   Embedding model (`text-embedding-004`) configured.
    *   Backend APIs for advanced filtering/ranking and batch scoring concurrency improvements are done.
    *   Work is needed on prompt refinement, full RAG integration (indexing, retrieval), advanced scoring logic, and specific recruiter UX features (UI for ranking, side-by-side comparison, etc.).

**Where We Are:**

We have a solid backend foundation capable of processing JDs and CVs, performing analysis with Gemini, and generating initial scores. The core data pipeline exists. The next major steps involve improving the *quality* of the AI analysis, making the system *usable* through a frontend, and layering in more *advanced* capabilities like RAG and sophisticated scoring.

**Prioritized Plan Moving Forward:**

*Status as of 2025-04-01: Completed Scoring Prompt Refinement, Upload UI, Upload API Integration, Agent Refinements (JD prompt, CV function calling), RAG Indexing, RAG Retrieval (Scoring Agent).* 

Here's the updated priority list:

**Priority 1: Advanced Scoring & Recruiter Features (Phase 5)** ‚úÖ **DONE**
*   **Task:** Research/implement advanced scoring (e.g., semantic similarity using embeddings), build related backend/frontend features (e.g., side-by-side comparison UI, ranking/filtering UI).
*   **Sub-Task (Semantic Similarity):** ‚úÖ DONE
*   **Sub-Task (Agentic RAG Integration - see P2):** ‚úÖ DONE
*   **Sub-Task (Side-by-Side UI):** ‚úÖ DONE
*   **SOTA:** Vector similarity, weighted criteria, Agentic RAG.
*   **Rationale:** Adds significant recruiter value and improves matching accuracy.

**Priority 2: Agentic RAG Implementation (Phase 5)** ‚úÖ **DONE**
*   **Task:** Evolve current RAG towards an Agentic RAG model. Implement query analysis/decomposition, dynamic retrieval strategies, relevance/quality checks, iterative refinement loops, and potential tool connections.
*   **Sub-Task (Core Components):** ‚úÖ DONE (Query Analysis, Dynamic Retrieval, Quality Checks, Refinement Loops)
*   **Sub-Task (Tool Integration):** ‚úÖ DONE
*   **SOTA:** Agentic RAG principles.
*   **Rationale:** Significantly improve analysis quality, robustness, and ability to handle complex requirements.

**Priority 3: RAG Implementation - Further Integration (Phase 5)** ‚úÖ **DONE**
*   **Task:** Explore augmenting prompts in *analysis* agents (JD/CV) with retrieved context if beneficial. Investigate RAG for market insights.
*   **Status:** Successfully implemented context injection for both JD and CV analysis agents. Added RAG capabilities to retrieve relevant documents from vector database and enhance analysis quality.
*   **SOTA:** Context injection.
*   **Rationale:** Potentially improve initial analysis quality.

**Priority 4: Testing & Deployment (Ongoing)** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **NEXT FOCUS**

*   **Task:** Implement comprehensive Unit/Integration tests. Define CI/CD and deployment strategy.
*   **Status:** Unit tests completed for `simple_scoring_agent.py` (77% coverage), `candidate_service.py` (97% coverage), `cv_analysis_agent.py` (84%), `agentic_rag_service.py` (91%), `code_execution_agent.py` (97%), `multimodal_agent.py` (complete), `integrated_agent.py` (95%), `tool_use_agent.py` (92%), and `jd_analysis_agent.py` (95%). Overall coverage improved (was 70%). Next focus: `job_service.py` (89% coverage - needs review?), `vector_db_service.py` (70%), and integration tests (50%).
*   **Rationale:** Ensures quality, maintainability, and reliability.

**Priority 5: Agent Improvement - Parsing Robustness (Phase 5)**

*   **Task:** Improve robustness of `extract_text_from_file` for different file types/layouts.
*   **Rationale:** Increases reliability for diverse user inputs.

**Priority 6: Frontend - Professional Styling (Phase 4)**

*   **Task:** Refine UI/UX, potentially implement PDF report generation.
*   **Rationale:** Improves user experience and presentation.

**Next Immediate Step:**

Based on this updated prioritization, the next step is **Priority 4: Testing & Deployment**, continuing to implement comprehensive unit and integration tests, likely starting with `candidate_service.py` or another low-coverage module.

**SOTA Techniques Summary:**

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Refining instructions, few-shot examples, structured output (JSON/Function Calling).
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Vector Embeddings (`text-embedding-004`), Vector Stores (ChromaDB), Chunking, Semantic Search, Context Injection.
*   **Agentic RAG:** ‚úÖ Query Analysis, ‚úÖ Dynamic Retrieval, ‚úÖ Quality Checks, ‚úÖ Smart Loops, ‚úÖ Tool Integration.
*   **Advanced Scoring:** Semantic Similarity (via embeddings), Weighted Criteria, potentially Graph Neural Networks (longer term).
*   **Structured Data Extraction:** Gemini Function Calling, robust JSON schema definition.
